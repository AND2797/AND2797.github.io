About Me
======
I am a graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary research interests are in Robotics (Perception & Learning) and Computing. I am interested in problems pertaining to structure from motion, pose estimation, and recognition.

I also enjoy interdisciplinary fields of research such as generative and computational design, as well as interfacings of machine learning & computer vision with materials science and mechanical engineering. Prior to starting at Carnegie Mellon I worked on developing mathematical models for explaining mechanical behaviour of novel variable stiffness composite materials using finite element modelling.
