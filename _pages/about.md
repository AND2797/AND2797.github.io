About Me
======
I am a graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary research interests are in Robotics (Perception & Learning) and Computing. I am interested in problems pertaining to structure from motion, pose estimation, and recognition. I am also interested in applications of Machine Learning and Computer Vision in Mechanical, Materials & Product Engineering.

Prior to starting at Carnegie Mellon I worked on developing mathematical models for numerical analyses of mechanical behaviour for novel variable stiffness composite materials using finite element modelling.
