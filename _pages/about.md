About Me
======
I am a graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary research interests are in Robotics (Perception & Learning) and Computing. I am interested in problems pertaining to structure from motion, pose estimation, and detection. I'm also interested in interfaces of Computer Vision with other fields of Engineering. 

Prior to starting at Carnegie Mellon I worked on developing mathematical models for numerical analyses of mechanical behaviour for novel variable stiffness composite materials using finite element modelling, some of our work resulted in a couple of publications.
