**Abstract**: _Here, the thermal buckling behaviour of variable stiffness laminated composite plates subjected to thermal loads
is numerically studied employing finite element approach based on first-order shear deformation theory.
In the composite laminate considered here, the fibre orientation varies continuously within the layer leading
to spatial variation of stiffness in the laminate. Different types of thermal loadings such as uniform and nonuniform temperature distributions are assumed in the analysis. The governing equations developed, applying the
principle of minimization of total potential energy, are solved through an eigenvalue approach. The displacement field of pre-buckling of the laminate is evaluated before proceeding for the thermal buckling analysis
depending on the type of temperature distributions. The formulation is tested against problems for which the
solutions are available. A detailed study considering various design parameters such as curvilinear fibre angles at
the centre and edge of the lamina, lay-up, thickness ratio, coefficients of thermal expansion, and modular ratio is
made on the critical buckling temperature. The present analysis shows the significant change in the critical
thermal buckling parameter while varying the curvilinear fibre angles and lay-up of the laminate._
