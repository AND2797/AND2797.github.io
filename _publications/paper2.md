**Abstract**: _In this paper, the large amplitude free flexural vibration characteristics of fairly thick and thin functionally graded graphene platelets reinforced porous curved composite beams are investigated using finite element approach. The formulation includes the influence of shear deformation which is represented through trigono- metric function and it accounts for in-plane and rotary inertia effects. The geometric non-linearity introducing von Karman’s assumptions is considered. The non-linear governing equations obtained based on Lagrange’s equations of motion are solved employing the direct iteration technique. The variation of non-linear frequency with amplitudes is brought out considering different parameters such as slenderness ratio of the beam, curved beam included angle, distribution pattern of porosity and graphene platelets, graphene platelet geometry and boundary conditions. The present study reveals the redistribution of vibrating mode shape at certain amplitude of vibration depending on geometric and material parameters of the curved composite beam. Also, the degree of hardening behaviour increases with the weight fraction and aspect ratio of graphene platelet. The rate of change of nonlinear behaviour depends on the level of amplitude of vibration, shallowness and slenderness ratio of the curved beam._
